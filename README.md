# Abstract

I investigate the most common problems encountered in binary dependent variable
models and proposed solutions. In particular, I examine the bias and inconsistency of
the following estimators: linear probability model, non-linear  xed e ects, and non-
linear random e ects. I discuss the bias correction for the non-linear  xed e ects model
proposed by Fern andez-Val (2009) and a solution to the initial conditions problem
proposed by Wooldridge (2005). Consequently, I conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to
compare the performance of various estimation techniques. The simulation indicates
that for the estimations of the coe cients one should use the random e ects estimator
for small values of T and be indi erent between the random e ects estimator and the
bias-corrected  xed e ects estimator for higher values of T. When marginal e ects
are the quantity of interest, one should use either the  xed e ects estimator or the
bias-corrected  xed e ects estimator.
